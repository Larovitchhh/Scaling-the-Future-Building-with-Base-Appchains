Base Appchains offer a compelling alternative to launching a standalone Layer 1 or Layer 2 blockchain. They provide:  Faster Time-to-Market: One-click deployment and managed infrastructure reduce setup time.  

Ecosystem Access: Retain Base’s liquidity, users, and developer tools while enjoying dedicated performance.  

Cost Efficiency: Fixed pricing and sub-cent transactions lower operational costs compared to shared blockspace.  

Proven Infrastructure: Built on OP Enclave, Appchains ensure security and fast withdrawals with Ethereum’s backing.  

Compared to shared blockspace, where apps face variable performance and unpredictable costs, Appchains deliver a consistent, high-performance environment tailored to your needs.
