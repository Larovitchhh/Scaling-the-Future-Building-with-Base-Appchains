Base Appchains are packed with features that make them an ideal choice for developers seeking scalability without sacrificing ecosystem benefits. Here’s a closer look at what they offer:High-Speed, Low-Cost Performance  1-Second Block Times: Appchains deliver transactions in under one second, enabling near-instant user experiences.  

Sub-Cent Transactions: Process transactions for fractions of a cent, significantly reducing costs for users and developers.  

Fast Withdrawals: Assets can move between Base Mainnet and Appchains in under 10 seconds, overcoming delays common in traditional bridging solutions.  

Dedicated Blockspace for Scalability
Appchains provide dedicated infrastructure, ensuring your app’s performance isn’t impacted by network congestion from other applications. This is critical for high-traffic apps like gaming platforms or DeFi protocols that require consistent throughput. For example, gaming platform Blocklords has processed over 80 million transactions across 1.8 million wallets using Base Appchains, demonstrating their scalability for large-scale ecosystems.  

Builder-Friendly Pricing  Fixed Monthly Costs: Replace unpredictable gas fees with a standard, fixed monthly pricing model, simplifying budgeting and eliminating gas sponsorship complexity.  

No Complex Contracts: Unlike traditional vendor commitments, Base Appchains offer straightforward pricing with no negotiation hassles.  

Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure  Fully Managed Sequencers and Nodes: Base handles maintenance, upgrades, and operations, allowing developers to focus on building rather than managing infrastructure.  

Real-Time Monitoring: Built-in performance alerts and a dedicated block explorer provide transparency and control.  

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs): Powered by the OP Enclave framework, Appchains use AWS S3 and AWS Nitro Enclaves for immediate state proving, ensuring security and fast withdrawals.
