Base Appchains are currently in beta with a waitlist for early access. Here’s how to get started:  Join the Beta Waitlist: Apply via the form on the Coinbase Developer Platform. Priority is given to mature projects with clear scaling needs.  

Technical Consultation: The Base team reviews your application and designs an optimal configuration based on your transaction patterns and requirements.  

Development and Testing: Access testnet features (starting at $1/month) to validate your architecture, including bridging, custom gas tokens, and permissions.  

Mainnet Launch: Deploy to production with full enterprise support, including monitoring and maintenance. A self-serve, one-click deployment option is coming soon.  

For technical details, explore the Base Documentation or the Base Engineering Blog. Developers can also use OnchainKit’s AppchainBridge component to enable seamless asset bridging between Base Mainnet and their Appchain.
